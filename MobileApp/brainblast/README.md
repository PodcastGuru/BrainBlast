# Brain Blast 

## üöÄ App Installation

### Prerequisites

- macOS (for iOS development)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Flutter on macOS

If you don't have Flutter installed on your macOS system, follow these steps:

1. **Install Homebrew** (if not installed):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   brew --version  # Verify installation
   ```

2. **Install Flutter using Homebrew**:
   ```bash
   brew install flutter
   ```

3. **Verify Flutter installation**:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```
   Follow any recommended fixes from the output.

4. **Add Flutter to PATH** (if required):
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:`flutter/bin`"
   ```
   To make this permanent, add the above line to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`.

5. **Install Xcode** (required for iOS development):
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```
   Then install Xcode from the App Store.

   After installation, run:
   ```bash
   sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
   ```

6. **Enable macOS desktop support**:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-macos-desktop
   ```

### Step 2: Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PodcastGuru/BrainBlast.git
   cd BrainBlast/MobileApp/brainblast
   ```
   
   Or extract the ZIP file and navigate to it:
   ```bash
   cd BrainBlast/MobileApp/brainblast
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Running the Game

### Step 3: Run on Multiple iOS Simulators

1. **Ensure Xcode & CocoaPods are properly installed**:
   ```bash
   sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
   sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
   sudo gem install cocoapods
   xcodebuild -version  # Verify Xcode installation
   ```

2. **Open multiple iOS simulators**:
   
   List available simulators:
   ```bash
   xcrun simctl list devices
   ```
   
   Boot multiple devices:
   ```bash
   xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 14"
   xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 13"
   ```
   
   Alternatively, open Xcode > Window > Devices and Simulators, then manually start multiple simulators.

3. **Run the Flutter app on multiple simulators**:
   
   List available devices:
   ```bash
   flutter devices
   ```
   
   To run on specific simulators, open separate Terminal windows and run:
   ```bash
   # In Terminal 1
   flutter run -d "iPhone 14"
   
   # In Terminal 2
   flutter run -d "iPhone 13"
   ```

### Step 4: Testing Multiplayer Functionality

1. **User Login on Each Device**:
   - Open the app on each simulator
   - On Simulator 1: Login with User 1 credentials
   - On Simulator 2: Login with User 2 credentials
   - Both users should successfully log in and navigate to the game lobby

2. **Creating and Joining a Game**:
   - **Simulator 1 (User 1)**:
     - Click "Create Game"
     - A unique game code is generated
     - Wait in the game lobby
   
   - **Simulator 2 (User 2)**:
     - Enter the game code shared by User 1
     - Click "Join Game"
     - Wait for the game to start

3. **Playing the Game**:
   - Once all players have joined, the host (User 1) starts the game
   - Answer questions as they appear
   - View real-time score updates
   - At the end of the game, view the final results

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with Flutter, run `flutter doctor` for diagnostics
- For iOS simulator issues, try resetting the simulator (iOS Simulator > Device > Erase All Content and Settings)
- Check the Firebase Console (if applicable) to verify user authentication and game session data




## üöÄ Backend Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.x or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PodcastGuru/BrainBlast.git
   cd BrainBlast/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration
   ```

4. **Seed the database with sample questions**
   ```bash

## üîë Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```dotenv
# Server Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000

# MongoDB
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/test

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_change_this_in_production
JWT_EXPIRE=30d
JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRE=30

# Client
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

## üèó Architecture

Brain Blast follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

1. **MVC Pattern**: Models, Controllers, Views separated
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic isolated from controllers
3. **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstracted
4. **Middleware Layer**: Request processing and validation
5. **Socket Events**: Organized by feature

### Request Flow:
```
Client Request ‚Üí Routes ‚Üí Middleware ‚Üí Controllers ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Models ‚Üí Database
```

### Real-time Flow:
```
Client Socket Event ‚Üí Socket Event Handlers ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Socket Emission ‚Üí Client
```

## üìú Game Rules

1. **Setup**:
   - Players can create new games or join existing ones
   - Players can directly challenge specific opponents
   - Game parameters can be customized (difficulty, subject, rounds)

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Each player answers the same randomly selected SAT math question per round
   - Players take turns answering questions (asynchronously)
   - Each player's timer starts when they begin viewing a question
   - Players receive immediate feedback on their answers

3. **Scoring**:
   - If both players answer correctly, the faster player wins the round
   - If both answer incorrectly, the round is a tie
   - If one answers correctly and the other incorrectly, the correct player wins
   - The first player to win 3 rounds (default, configurable) wins the game

4. **Challenge System**:
   - Players can browse other online users
   - Players can send game challenges with custom settings
   - Challenged players can accept or reject challenges
   - Both players receive real-time notifications about challenge status

## üîÑ Project Flow

### Standard Game Flow

1. **Game Creation**
   - Player 1 creates a game via API
   - Backend generates a game code
   - Player 1 connects to socket.io with game code

2. **Game Joining**
   - Player 2 joins with game code via API
   - Backend adds player to game, creates first round
   - Both players connect to socket.io with game code
   - Backend notifies Player 1 it's their turn

3. **Gameplay Loop**
   - Current player receives notification
   - Player submits answer via socket
   - Backend processes answer, switches turn
   - Next player receives turn notification
   - After both players answer, backend evaluates round
   - Both players receive round results
   - Process repeats until win condition met

4. **Game Completion**
   - Backend determines winner
   - Both players receive game completion notification
   - Player statistics are updated
