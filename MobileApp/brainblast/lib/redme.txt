‚úÖ Step 1: Install Flutter on macOS (If Not Installed)
If Flutter is not installed on your macOS system, follow these steps:

1. Install Homebrew (if not installed)
Open Terminal and run:

sh
Copy
Edit
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Verify the installation by running:

sh
Copy
Edit
brew --version
2. Install Flutter Using Homebrew
Run the following command:

sh
Copy
Edit
brew install flutter
3. Verify Flutter Installation
Once the installation is complete, check if Flutter is installed correctly:

sh
Copy
Edit
flutter doctor
If any issues appear, follow the recommended fixes in the output.

4. Add Flutter to PATH (If Required)
If Flutter is not recognized, manually add it to your system path:

sh
Copy
Edit
export PATH="$PATH:`flutter/bin`"
To make this permanent, add the above line to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile.

5. Install Xcode (Required for macOS & iOS Development)
sh
Copy
Edit
xcode-select --install
Then, open the App Store, search for Xcode, and install it.

After installation, run:

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
6. Enable macOS Desktop Support in Flutter
sh
Copy
Edit
flutter config --enable-macos-desktop
‚úÖ Flutter is now installed on macOS! You can proceed to the next steps to run your multiplayer game. üöÄ

‚úÖ Step 2: Project Setup on macOS
After installing Flutter, you need to set up your Flutter multiplayer game project. Follow these steps carefully:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone or Extract the Project Files
If your project is on GitHub, open Terminal and run:

sh
Copy
Edit
git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_LINK>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER>
If you have a ZIP file, extract it to a folder and navigate to it in Terminal:

sh
Copy
Edit
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Flutter Dependencies
Run the following command inside your project folder:

sh
Copy
Edit
flutter pub get
This installs all required dependencies from pubspec.yaml.

‚úÖ Step 3: Run the Flutter Multiplayer Game on Multiple iOS Simulators
To test your Flutter multiplayer game on multiple iOS simulators, follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure Xcode & CocoaPods Are Installed
Since iOS apps require Xcode and CocoaPods, run:

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
sudo gem install cocoapods
Verify Xcode is installed:

sh
Copy
Edit
xcodebuild -version
2Ô∏è‚É£ Open Multiple iOS Simulators
To list available simulators, run:

sh
Copy
Edit
xcrun simctl list devices
To boot multiple devices (replace DEVICE_ID with actual IDs from the list):

sh
Copy
Edit
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 14"
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 13"
Alternatively, open Xcode > Window > Devices and Simulators, then manually start multiple simulators.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Flutter App on Multiple iOS Simulators
Run this command to list available devices:

sh
Copy
Edit
flutter devices
To launch the app on a specific simulator (e.g., iPhone 14):

sh
Copy
Edit
flutter run -d "iPhone 14"
To run on multiple simulators, open separate Terminal windows and run:

sh
Copy
Edit
flutter run -d "iPhone 14"
sh
Copy
Edit
flutter run -d "iPhone 13"

‚úÖ Step 4: Running the Multiplayer Game with Multiple Users on iOS Simulators
After setting up and running your Flutter multiplayer game on multiple iOS simulators, follow these steps to test user login, game creation, and gameplay.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Launch Multiple iOS Simulators
Open multiple simulators using Terminal:

sh
Copy
Edit
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 14"
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 13"
Or open Xcode ‚Üí Window ‚Üí Devices and Simulators ‚Üí Manually start multiple simulators.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Flutter App on Each Simulator
In separate Terminal windows, run:

sh
Copy
Edit
flutter run -d "iPhone 14"
sh
Copy
Edit
flutter run -d "iPhone 13"
This launches the game on both devices.

3Ô∏è‚É£ User Login on Each Device
Open the app on each simulator.

On Simulator 1 (iPhone 14) ‚Üí Login with User 1 (e.g., user1@example.com).

On Simulator 2 (iPhone 13) ‚Üí Login with User 2 (e.g., user2@example.com).

Ensure both users successfully log in and navigate to the game lobby.

‚úÖ If using Firebase Authentication, check the Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication to verify logged-in users.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Creating and Joining a Game
Simulator 1 (User 1) creates a game:

Click "Create Game"

A unique game code is generated.

Wait in the game lobby.

Simulator 2 (User 2) joins the game:

Enter the game code shared by User 1.

Click "Join Game".

Wait for the game to start.

‚úÖ If using Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore, check that the game session is created in the database.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Answering Questions in Multiplayer Mode
Once all players have joined, the host (User 1) starts the game.

The first quiz question appears for both users.

Users select their answers and submit.

The system processes responses and updates scores.

Repeat for the remaining questions.

‚úÖ Check real-time updates in Firebase Database or the backend to verify game logic.
