",,Hard,-10,2/5,2,5/2,D,"
The correct answer is D. A system of two linear equations in two variables, m and n, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the mn-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in standard form, Am+Bn=C and Dm+En=F, are parallel if the coefficients for m and n in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation, meaning D/A=E/B; and the lines are distinct if the constants are not proportional, meaning F/C is not equal to D/A or E/B. The first equation in the given system is: 7/2 n- 1/2m=3/4-3/2 n Multiplying each side of this equation by 8 yields:
28n-4m=6-12n Adding 12n to each side of this equation yields, 40n-4m=6, or -2m+20n=3 The second equation in the given system is: 3/4 m+1/4-m/2=kn+13/4 Multiplying each side of this equation by 4 yields: 3m+1-2m=4kn+13 or m+1=4kn+13 Subtracting 4kn from each side of this equation yields: m+1-4kn=13  Subtracting 1 from each side of this equation yields: m-4kn=12  Therefore, the two equations in the given system, written in standard form, are: -2m+20n=3 and m-4kn=12  As previously stated, if this system has no solution, the lines represented by the equations in the mn -plane are parallel and distinct, meaning the proportion: 1/(-2)=(-4k)/20, or -1/2=(-k)/5, is true, and the proportion 12/3=1/(-2) is not true. The proportion 12/3=1/(-2) is not true. Multiplying each side of the true proportion, -1/2=(-k)/5, by -5 yields, 5/2=k  Therefore, if the system has no solution, then the value of k is 5/2.

",,Hard,-19,-5,5,19,D,"
Choice D is correct. It's given that the graphs of the given system of equations intersect at the point (4,y). Therefore, (4,y) is the solution to the given system. Multiplying the first equation in the given system by -2 yields -2px-4qy=-166. Adding this equation to the second equation in the system gives (-2p+14)x+(-4q+4q)y=(-166+70), or (-2p+14)x=-96.
Since (4,y) is the solution to the system, the value of p can be found by substituting 4 for x in this equation, which yields (-2p+14)(4)=-96. Dividing both sides of this equation by 4 yields -2p+14=-24. Subtracting 14 from both sides gives -2p=-38.

Choice D is correct. A system of two linear equations in two variables, p and q, has zero solutions if the lines representing the equations in the pq-plane are distinct and parallel. Two lines are distinct and parallel if they have the same slope but different q-intercepts. Each equation in the system can be written in slope-intercept form q=mp+b, where m is the slope of the line, and (0,b) is the q-intercept. Adding 9p to both sides of the first equation, -9p+18q=24, gives 18q=9p+24. Dividing both sides by 18 yields q=9/18 p+24/18 or  q=1/2 p+4/3. This shows the first equation has a slope of 1/2 and a q -intercept of (0,4/3). Adding 3p to both sides of the second equation, -3p+6q=-8, gives 6q=3p-8. Dividing both sides by 6 yields q=3/6 p-8/6 or q=1/2 p-4/3 . This shows the second equation also has a slope of 1/2 but a q intercept of (0,-4/3). Since the slopes are the same but the q-intercepts are different, the lines are distinct and parallel, and the system has zero solutions.

Alternate approach: To solve the system by elimination, multiply the second equation, -3p+6q=-8, by -3 , yielding 9p-18q=24. Adding this equation to the first equation, -9p+18q=24, gives, (-9p+9p)+(-18q+18q)=24+24, or 0=48, which is a contradiction. Since this equation isn't true, the given system of equations has zero solutions.

In the given system of equations, s is a constant. If the system has no solution, what is the value of s ?
",,Hard,-16,-6,16,400,A,"The correct answer is A . A system of two linear equations in two variables, p and q, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the pq-plane are distinct and parallel. The graphs of two lines in the pq-plane represented by equations in the form Ap+Bq=C, where A,B, and C are constants, are parallel if the coefficients of p and q in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation. The first equation in the system, 30p-54q=26q+37, can be rewritten in the form Ap+ Bq=C by subtracting 26q from both sides, yielding 30p-80q=37. The second equation, sq=1/5-6p, can also be rewritten. Adding 6p to both sides yields 6p+ sq=1/5. Now compare the coefficients of p and q for the two equations. The coefficient of p in the second equation is 1/5 of the coefficient of p in the first equation because 30×1/5=6. For the lines to be parallel, the coefficient of q in the second equation must also be 1/5 of the coefficient of q in the first equation. Therefore, -80×1/5=s, or s=-16. Thus, if the given system has no solution, the value of s is -16.

Multiplying both sides of the second equation in the system by -5 yields -5kn=-1-5m, or -1-5m=-5kn. Adding this equation to the first equation, 5m-15n=10n+25, gives: (5m-15n)+(-1-5m)=(10n+25)+(-5kn), or -1-15n=10n-5kn+25. Subtracting 10n from both sides gives:
(-1-15n)-10n=(10n-5kn+25)-10n or -1-25n=-5kn+25. If the system has no solution, then the equation -1-25n=-5kn+25 must have no solution. For this to happen, the coefficients of n on each side of the equation, -25 and -5k, must be equal. This gives the equation -25=-5k. Dividing both sides by -5 yields k=5.

Alternate Approach:
A system of two linear equations in two variables, m and n, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the mn-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in the form Am+Bn=C, where A,B, and C are constant terms, are parallel if the ratio of the m coefficients is equal to the ratio of the n-coefficients, and distinct if the ratio of the m-coefficients is not equal to the ratio of the constant terms. Subtracting 10 n from both sides of the first equation gives, (5m-15n)-(10n)=(10n+25)-(10n), or 5m-25n=25. Subtracting m from both sides of the second equation gives, (kn)-(m)=(1/5+m)-(m), or -m+kn=1/5 . The ratio of the m-coefficients is -1/5. The ratio of the n-coefficients is -k/25. The ratio of the constant terms is (1/5)/25, or 1/125. Since the ratio of the m-coefficients, -1/5, is not equal to the ratio of the constants, 1/125, the lines represented by the equations are distinct. Setting the ratio of the m-coefficients equal to the ratio of the n-coefficients gives: -1/5=-k/25. Multiplying both sides by -25 yields (-1/5)(-25)=(-k/25)(-25), or k=5.
Thus, if the system has no solution, the value of k is 5 .

So, the number of hours he walked can be represented by the expression p/7, and the number of hours he skated can be represented by the expression q/14. It's given that he skated for thrice as many hours as he walked, so this can be represented by the equation q/14=3(p/7), which can be rewritten as q=6p. It's also given that he walked p miles and skated q miles, and that he walked and skated a total of 350 miles. This can be represented by the equation p+q=350. Substituting 6p for q in this equation yields p+6p=350, or 7p=350. Solving for p yields p=50.

Adding 16 from each side of the first equation in the given system, 9a-16=mb, yields 9a=mb+16. Adding 7b to each side of the second equation in the given system, 9a-7b=8b+26, yields 9a=15b+26. Since the left-hand side of each equation is equal to 9a, setting the right-hand sides of the equations equal to each other yields mb+16=15b+26. A linear equation in one variable, b, has no solution if and only if the equation is false; that is, when there's no value of b that produces a true statement. For the equation mb+16=15b+26, there's no value of b that produces a true statement when mb=15b. Therefore, for the equation mb+16=15b+26, there's no value of b that produces a true statement when the value of m is 15 .

The graphs of two lines in the xy-plane represented by equations in slope-intercept form, y=mx+b, are distinct if the y-coordinates of their y-intercepts, b, are different and are parallel if their slopes, m , are the same.
For the two equations in the given system, y=-3x+5 and y=-3x-5, the values of b are 5 and -5 , respectively, and the values of m are both -3 . Since the values of b are different, the graphs of these lines have different y-coordinates of the y-intercept and are distinct.

If the extractor continues to remove wheat at this rate, what is the total number of hours Daniel will have been using the extractor when 13,361 bushels of wheat remain in the silo?",,Hard,5,7,9,13,D,"Choice D is correct. After using the extractor for 6 hours, Daniel had removed 29,000-21,782= 7,218 bushels of wheat from the silo. During the 6 -hour period, the extractor removed wheat from the silo at a constant rate of 7,218÷6=1,203 bushels per hour. Assuming the extractor continues to remove wheat at this rate, after t hours it will have removed 1203t bushels of wheat.
Since the silo initially contained 29,000 bushels of wheat, the equation 29,000-1203t=13,361 can be used to find the number of hours, t, Daniel will have been using the extractor when 13,361 bushels of wheat remain. Subtracting 13,361 from both sides of this equation and adding 1203t to both sides gives:

Choice A is correct. The linear relationship between x and y can be represented by the equation y=mx+b, where m is the slope of the line in the xy-plane that represents the relationship, and b is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept. The slope can be computed using any two points on the line. The slope of a line between any two points, (x_1,y_1 ) and (x_2, y_2 ), on the line can be calculated using the slope formula, m=(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1). In the given table, each value of x and its corresponding value of y can be represented by a point (x,y). In the given table, when the value of x is -3, the corresponding value of y is 7 and when the value of x is -2, the corresponding value of y is 11. Therefore, the points (-3,7) and (-2,11) are on the line. Substituting (-3,7) and (-2,11) for (x_1,y_1 ) and (x_2,y_2 ), respectively, in the slope formula yields m=(11-7)/(-2+3), or m=4. Substituting 4 for m in the equation y=mx+b yields y=4x+b.
Substituting -1 for x, and its corresponding value of y, 15, for x and y, respectively, in this equation yields 15=4(-1)+b, or 15=b-4. Adding 4 to both sides of this equation yields 19=b. Substituting 19 for b in the equation y=4x+b yields y=4x+19. Therefore, the equation y=4x+19 represents the linear relationship between x and y.

8/4 x+2/17 y=132. Subtracting 8/4 x or 2x from both sides of this equation yields 2/17y=-2x+132. Dividing both sides by 2 yields 1/17 y=-x+66. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 17 yields y=-17 x+1,122. Therefore, the slope of line h is -17. It's given that line j is perpendicular to line h in the xy-plane. Two lines are perpendicular if their slopes are negative reciprocals, meaning that the slope of the first line is equal to -1 divided by the slope of the second line. Therefore, the slope of line j is the negative reciprocal of the slope of line h. The negative reciprocal of -17 is (-1)/((-17) ), or 1/17. Therefore, the slope of line j is 1/17.

Choice A is incorrect. This is the slope of a line in the xy-plane that is parallel, not perpendicular, to line h.

Choice B is incorrect. This is the reciprocal, not the negative reciprocal, of -17.

Choice D is incorrect. This is the negative, not the negative reciprocal, of -17.

If the slope of the line is 5 , what is the value of k+n ?",,Hard,1,8,9,10,D,"The correct answer is D. The slope of a line can be found by using the slope formula, (y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1 ). It's given that the slope of the line is 5; therefore, (y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1 )=5. According to the table, the points (8,-13/2) and (k,-3/2) lie on the line. Substituting the coordinates of these points into the equation gives (-3/2-(-13/2))/(k-8)=5. Multiplying both sides of this equation by k-8 gives 13/2-3/2=5(k-8), or 10/2=5k-40. Solving for k gives k=9. According to the table, the points (8,-13/2) and (19/2,n) also lie on the line. Substituting the coordinates of these points into (y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1 )=5 gives (n+13/2)/(19/2-8)=5. Solving the denominator gives (n+13/2)/3/2=5.

Two lines are perpendicular if their slopes are negative reciprocals, meaning that the slope of the first line is equal to -1 divided by the slope of the second line. Each equation in the given pair of equations can be written in slope-intercept form, y=mx+b, where m is the slope of the graph of the equation in the xy-plane and (0,b) is the y intercept. For the first equation, 
3/2 x-5/2 y=1, multiplying both sides by 2 gives 3x-5y=2 .Subtracting 3x from both sides gives -5y=-3x+2, and dividing both sides of this equation by -5 gives 
y=3/5 x-2/5. Therefore, the slope of the graph of this equation is 3/5. For the second equation, 3by-5ax=1, adding 5ax to both sides gives 3by=5ax+1, and dividing both sides of this equation by 3b gives y=5a/3b x+1/3b. Therefore, the slope of the graph of this equation is 5a/3b. Since the graph of the given pair of equations is a pair of perpendicular lines, the slope of the graph of the second equation, 5a/3b, must be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the graph of the first equation, 3/5. The negative reciprocal of 3/5 is (-1)/((3/5) ), or -5/3.
Therefore, 5a/3b=-5/3, or a/b=-1/1. Similarly, rewriting the equations in choice B in slope-intercept form yields y=3x/10-1/10 and y=20ax/6b+1/6b. It follows that the slope of the graph of the first equation in choice B is 3/10 and the slope of the graph of the second equation in choice B is 20a/6b. Since a/b=-1, .

It's given that there is a linear relationship between the number of servers, s, in a data center and the maximum number of concurrent users, u, that the system can handle. It follows that this relationship can be represented by an equation of the form u=ms+b where m is the rate of change of u in this relationship and b is a constant. The rate of change of u in this relationship can be calculated by dividing the difference in any two values of u by the difference in the corresponding values of s. Using two pairs of values given in the table, the rate of change of u in this relationship is (299-94)/(7-2), or 41 . Substituting 41 for m in the equation u=ms+b yields u=41s+b. The value of b can be found by substituting any value of s and its corresponding value of u for s and u, respectively, in this equation. Substituting 10 for s and 422 for u yields 422=41(10)+b, or 422=410+b. Subtracting 410 from both sides of this equation yields 12=b. Substituting 12 for b in the equation u=41s+b yields u=41s+12.

Choice A is correct. It's given that the graph of the linear function y=g(x)+23 is shown. This implies that the graph of y=g(x)+23 can be translated downward by 23 units to create the graph of y=g(x), and the y-coordinate of every point on the graph of y=g(x)+23 can be decreased by 23 to find the corresponding point on the graph of y=g(x). The y-intercept of the graph of y=g(x)+23 is (0,9). Translating the graph down by 23 units results in a y-intercept for the graph of y=g(x) at the point (0,9-23), or (0,-14). The graph of y=g(x)+23 slants downward from left to right, indicating that the slope is negative. The translation of a linear graph modifies its position but does not alter its slope. Thus, the slope of the graph of y=g(x) remains negative. The equation of a linear function g can be expressed in the form g(x)=b+mx, where b is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept and m is the slope of the graph.

Solving for x gives x - 3 = 0, hence x = 3. Thus, the average cost of electricity is $3.12 per megawatt-hour 3 months after April 1, 2019, which corresponds to July 1, 2019.

Choice A is incorrect. The constant 3.12 represents a specific price, not the rate of change, which is indicated by the -0.22 coefficient. 
Choice B is incorrect as it misunderstands the consultant's role. The difference in the average cost from April 1, 2019, to July 1, 2019, is calculated by J(3) - J(0) = 3.12 - 0.22(3 - 3) - (3.12 - 0.22(0 - 3)) = 3.12 - (3.12 + 0.66) = -0.66, not 3.12.

",,Easy,20h+30s≤150,20h+30s≥150,30h+20s≤150,30h+20s≥150,A,"
Choice A is correct. Since the price of each pair of headphones is $20 and Max buys h pairs, the expression 20h represents the amount Max spends on headphones. Since the price of each speaker is $30 and Max buys s speakers, the expression 30s represents the amount Max spends on speakers. Therefore, the sum 20h+30s represents the total amount Max spends at the store. Since Max can spend at most $150 at the store, the total amount he spends must be less than or equal to $150.

Alternatively, customers can pay $2.00, $3.00, or $4.00 per visit, depending on the type of activity they choose. What is the minimum number of visits per month for which a monthly membership could cost less than paying for individual visits?",,Hard,27,28,36,55,B,"The correct answer is B. The minimum number of individual visits for which the cost of the monthly membership is less than the cost of individual visits can be found by assuming the maximum cost of an individual visit, $4.00.
If v visits costing $4.00 each are made in one month, the inequality:
110<4.00v represents this situation.
Dividing both sides of the inequality by 4.00 yields: 27.5<v, which is equivalent to v>27.5.

Since only a whole number of visits can occur, it follows that 28 is the minimum number of visits.

Which of the following inequalities represents all possible values of total project revenue p, in dollars, the consultant can generate this year to meet that goal?",,Hard,1b≤p≤2b,b/0.15 ≤p≤2b/0.15 ,2b≤p≤3b,2b/0.15 ≤p≤3b/0.15 ,B,"Choice B is correct. It's given that a consultant's total compensation consists of a base fee of b dollars per year plus bonus earnings of 15% of the total project revenue p generated during the year. The consultant's total compensation can be represented by the expression b+0.15p. It's also given that the consultant's goal is for the total compensation to be at least 2 times and at most 3 times the base fee, which can be expressed as 2b and 3b, respectively.
This situation can be represented by the inequality: 2b≤b+0.15p≤3b 
Subtracting b from each part of the inequality yields: 1b≤0.15p≤2b 
Dividing each part of the inequality by 0.15 gives: 1/0.15 b≤p≤2/0.15 b 

Choice A is incorrect because it represents a situation where the total project revenue, rather than the total compensation, is at least 1 times and at most 2 times the base fee.

Choice C is incorrect because it represents a situation where the total project revenue is at least 2 times and at most 3 times the base fee.

ALG165,Linear Inequalities,,"A number x is at most 5 less than 4 times the value of y. If the value of y is -3 , what is the greatest possible value of x ?",,Hard,-17,-7,17,19,A,"The correct answer is A . It's given that a number x is at most 5 less than 4 times the value of y. Therefore, x is less than or equal to 5 less than 4 times the value of y. The expression 4y represents 4 times the value of y. The expression 4y-5 represents 5 less than 4 times the value of y. Thus, x is less than or equal to 4y-5, which can be written as: x≤4y-5 
Substituting -3 for y in this inequality gives: x≤4(-3)-5, or  x≤-17 

Therefore, if the value of y is -3 , the greatest possible value of x is -17.

ALG166,Linear Inequalities,,"A party planner budgets $3,000 to purchase decorations. The planner must purchase a minimum of 250 decorations to maintain the discounted pricing.
If the planner pays $5.50 per decoration for small items and $14.00 per decoration for large items, what is the maximum number of large items the planner can purchase to stay within the budget and maintain the discounted pricing?
",,Hard,191,192,214,545,A,"The correct answer is A. Let s represent the number of small decorations the planner can purchase, and let l represent the number of large decorations the planner can purchase. It is given that the planner pays $5.50 per small decoration and $14.00 per large decoration. Therefore, the planner pays 5.50 s dollars for s small decorations and 14.00l dollars for l large decorations. The total cost of the decorations is represented as: 5.50s+14.00l 
The planner budgets $3,000 for decorations, so: 5.50s+14.00l≤3,000 
It is also given that the planner must purchase at least 250 decorations, so:
s+l≥250 
Rewriting s+l≥250, subtracting l from both sides gives: s≥250-l 
Multiplying both sides by 5.50 gives: 5.50s≥5.50(250-l), or   5.50s≥1,375-5.50l.) 
Adding 14.00l to both sides gives: 5.50s+14.00l≥1,375-5.50l+14.00l, or:  5.50s+14.00l≥1,375+8.50l.) 
This inequality can be combined with 5.50s+14.00l≤3,000, resulting in:
1,375+8.50l≤5.50s+14.00l≤3,000 
From this, it follows that: 1,375+8.50l≤3,000 
Subtracting 1,375 from both sides gives: 8.50l≤1,625 
Dividing by 8.50 yields: l≤191.18 

Since the number of large decorations must be a whole number, the maximum number of large decorations the planner can purchase is the largest whole number less than 191.18, which is 191.

(48 + q)/400 > 0.25. Multiplying both sides by 400 gives:
q + 48 > 0.25(400). Since q represents the number of people among the remaining 200 participants, q ≤ 200.

It's given that a triangle has side lengths of 8 and 15 , and y represents the length of the third side of the triangle. By the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Thus, the inequalities 8+y>15, 8+15>y, and 15+y>8 represent all possible values of y. Subtracting 8 from both sides of 8+y>15 gives y>15-8, or y>7.
Adding 8 and 15 in 8+15>y gives 23>y, or y<23. Subtracting 15 from both sides of 15+y>8 gives y>8-15, or y>-7. Since all y-values satisfying y>7 also satisfy y>-7, it follows that y>7 and y<23 represent the possible values of y. Therefore, the inequality 7<y<23 represents the possible lengths of the third side.

Choice A is incorrect because it gives the upper bound for y but does not include the lower bound.

Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

ALG170,Linear Inequalities,,The inequality y < 5x + 3 is given. For which of the following tables are all the values of x and their corresponding values of y solutions to the given inequality?,,Hard,,,,,C,"Choice C is correct. All the tables in the choices have the same three values of x, so each of the three values of x can be substituted in the given inequality to compare the corresponding values of y in each of the tables.

Substituting x = 2 in the given inequality yields y < 5(2) + 3, or y < 13. Therefore, when x = 2, the corresponding value of y must be less than 13.
Substituting x = 4 in the given inequality yields y < 5(4) + 3, or y < 23. Therefore, when x = 4, the corresponding value of y must be less than 23.
Substituting x = 6 in the given inequality yields y < 5(6) + 3, or y < 33. Therefore, when x = 6, the corresponding value of y must be less than 33.

For the table in choice C:

When x = 2, y = 12, which is less than 13.
When x = 4, y = 22, which is less than 23.
When x = 6, y = 32, which is less than 33.

The total of Ava's earnings, in dollars, for the week will be 16k+112. 

She saves 85% of her earnings each week, so this week she will save 0.85(16k+112) dollars. The inequality 0.85(16k+112)≥340 represents the condition that she will save at least $340 for the week.
Factoring 16 out of the expression 16k+112 gives 16(k+7). The product of 16 and 0.85 is 13.6, so the inequality can be rewritten as: 13.6(k+7)≥340
