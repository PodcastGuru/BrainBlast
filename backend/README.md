# Brain Blast 

## üèó Architecture

Brain Blast follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

1. **MVC Pattern**: Models, Controllers, Views separated
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic isolated from controllers
3. **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstracted
4. **Middleware Layer**: Request processing and validation
5. **Socket Events**: Organized by feature

### Request Flow:
```
Client Request ‚Üí Routes ‚Üí Middleware ‚Üí Controllers ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Models ‚Üí Database
```

### Real-time Flow:
```
Client Socket Event ‚Üí Socket Event Handlers ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Socket Emission ‚Üí Client
```

## üìú Game Rules

1. **Setup**:
   - Players can create new games or join existing ones
   - Players can directly challenge specific opponents
   - Game parameters can be customized (difficulty, subject, rounds)

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Each player answers the same randomly selected SAT math question per round
   - Players take turns answering questions (asynchronously)
   - Each player's timer starts when they begin viewing a question
   - Players receive immediate feedback on their answers

3. **Scoring**:
   - If both players answer correctly, the faster player wins the round
   - If both answer incorrectly, the round is a tie
   - If one answers correctly and the other incorrectly, the correct player wins
   - The first player to win 3 rounds (default, configurable) wins the game

4. **Challenge System**:
   - Players can browse other online users
   - Players can send game challenges with custom settings
   - Challenged players can accept or reject challenges
   - Both players receive real-time notifications about challenge status

## üîÑ Project Flow

### Standard Game Flow

1. **Game Creation**
   - Player 1 creates a game via API
   - Backend generates a game code
   - Player 1 connects to socket.io with game code

2. **Game Joining**
   - Player 2 joins with game code via API
   - Backend adds player to game, creates first round
   - Both players connect to socket.io with game code
   - Backend notifies Player 1 it's their turn

3. **Gameplay Loop**
   - Current player receives notification
   - Player submits answer via socket
   - Backend processes answer, switches turn
   - Next player receives turn notification
   - After both players answer, backend evaluates round
   - Both players receive round results
   - Process repeats until win condition met

4. **Game Completion**
   - Backend determines winner
   - Both players receive game completion notification
   - Player statistics are updated
